    h1 About Myself
    h2.fragment An enthusiast software engineer
    p.fragment Passionate about languages and compilers
    p.fragment.roll-in <b>Worked in the V8 team in Google</b>
    p.fragment Overall, worked on JIT compilers for +7 years
    p.fragment
      | Now working on scalable, fault tolerant,
      br
      | web facing distributed systems

  section
    h1 Javascript and me
    p.fragment I started as a Javascript hater
    blockquote.fragment.embox.roll-in
      | When I sow Javascript for the 1st time (in 1995)
      | I vowed that I would never touch such an abomination,
      | even with a 10 feet pole
    p.fragment Eventually, I changed my mind, but...
    p.fragment
      em Let's change subject!

section
  h1 What are we talking about?
  p.fragment Functional programming
  p.fragment Functional programming in Javascript
  p.fragment Utility libraries for base algorithms
  p.fragment Approaches to asynchronous data processing
  blockquote.fragment.embox.roll-in Hope you'll have fun!

section
  h1 Functional Programming is...
  p.fragment
    veryBig a fashionable trend!

section
  h1 What does it mean?
  p.fragment First-class and higher-order functions
  p.fragment Pure functions (no side effects)
  p.fragment Describe what to compute and not how to do it

section
  h1 Less object oriented
  p.fragment No mutable objects
  p.fragment General functions instead of specific methods
  p.fragment No entanglement of code and state


section
  h1 Why is underscore.js popular?
  p.fragment Functional approach (no monkey patching)
  p.fragment Provides useful functions that...
  ul
    li.fragment say what you want to do (each, map, filter...)
    li.fragment instead of writing loops (how to do it)


section
  h1 Seriously...
  br
  p.fragment
    veryBig
      | Take the
      br
      a(href='http://joelhooks.com/blog/2014/02/06/stop-writing-for-loops-start-using-underscorejs') 30 days no-loop
      br
      br
      | challenge!

section
  h1 Isn't lodash better?
  br
  p.fragment No flame wars, please!
  p.fragment It improves:
  ul.fragment
    li completeness
    li performance
    li coherence
    li customizability
  p.fragment.embox.roll-in Otherwise, it is really similar


section
  h1 What about Ramda?
  p.fragment It makes functional best practices even simpler
  p.fragment Function composition is useful if you have useful building blocks to compose
  p.fragment Rambda makes currying the default, making it easy to build the building blocks!


section
  h1 Let's prove the point
  pre.codebox.fragment
    code.codesmall.javascript.
      var incompleteTasks = tasks.filter(task => !task.complete);
  pre.codebox.fragment
    code.codesmall.javascript.
      var incompleteTasks = _.filter(tasks, {complete: false});
  pre.codebox.fragment
    code.codesmall.javascript.
      var incomplete = R.filter(R.where({complete: false});
      var incompleteTasks = incomplete(tasks);
