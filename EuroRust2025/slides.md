Line Followers
---

##### there are...

#### 🏎️💨 fast ones 🏎️💨
#### 6㎧ on straight lines
##### 💥 engineering marvels 💥

#### 🤖 Lego ones 🤖
#### 🐌 much slower 🐌
#### 1㎧ overall speed
#### 🤔 different challenges 🤔

---

A Childish Line Follower
---

#### use only two sensors
#### if one side senses, turn that way
#### otherwise, go straight

---

Can we do better?
---

#### this robot is "binary"
#### it does not have proportional reactions
#### how can we improve it?

---

Analog Sensors
---

#### use analog sensors
#### a strange configuration
#### PICTURE sensors image
#### sub millimeter accuracy

---

Use a 🅿 🅸 🅳 Controller
---

#### What is it?

```
🅿 Proportional
🅸 Integral
🅳 Derivative
```

##### given three constants `k`: `ₖ🄿 ` `ₖ🄸 ` `ₖ🄳 `

##### `turn` = ⓔ ⋅`ₖ🄿 ` + (∫ⓔ dt)⋅`ₖ🄸 ` + (dⓔ /dt)⋅`ₖ🄳 `

##### this gives smooth trajectory control

---

BUT WAIT
---

##### 🦀 What About Rust? 🦀
##### 🤔 isn't this a Rust conference? 🤔

---

Why Rust...
---

#### ...in a hobby robotic project?
#### to learn the language
#### to avoid mistakes
#### because it is possible!

---

🦀 Rust on a EV3 🤖
---

#### original firmware
#### (let's skip this)

#### `ev3dev` (a Debian port)
#### unpredictable latency (up to 20㎳)

#### 🤔 why is latency an issue ❓

---

Hard Real Time
---

#### the PID runs in an event loop
#### a late result is a wrong result
#### how fast is fast enough?
#### not
#### as fast as possible
#### but
#### as fast as needed

---

Line Follower Latency
---

#### PICTURE 90 turn image

#### bot speed:
#### 1.0㎧: 2㎳ ➡ 2㎜
#### 1.5㎧: 2㎳ ➡ 3㎜
#### 2.0㎧: 2㎳ ➡ 4㎜

#### line width: 20㎜
#### max latency: about 3㎳

---

Enter EV3RT
---

#### a port of TOPPERS HRP2
#### an industrial Real Time OS
#### 💥 Open Source 💥
#### docs and comments in 🇯🇵 Japanese 😮

#### 😄 with a usable C SDK 👍

---

🦀 Rust on EV3RT 💻
---

#### wrapping the C API is easy
#### EV3RT has a dynamic program loader
#### programs are "custom" ELF files
#### the linker script is crazy

---

🦀 Rust, EV3RT, and Linking 🔗
---

#### compile a sample EV3RT C app
#### with a trivial `main()`
#### compile Rust code to a static lib
#### replace the `main` C `.o` file
#### with the Rust `.a` library
#### use the EV3RT linbker script

---

💻 EV3RT 🦀 Rust `API` 💻
---

#### simple, imperative low-level API
#### read and write to every EV3 port
#### handle every sensor and motor
#### get time (㎲) and sleep (㎳)

#### usable, but not enough

---

The Need for `async`
---

#### (not really in this robot)
#### sensors read rate mismatches
#### NXT analog: 3㎳
#### Ultrasound: 20㎳
#### RGB color: 1㎳

#### a logic loop read in parallel
#### RGB color data every 1ms, and also
#### get Ultrasound updates every 20㎳

---

The Need for `async`
---

#### robot logic can be composed of
#### different parallel state machines

#### process line error
#### (dⓔ/dt, ∫ⓔdt, filtering)

#### process motor status
#### (compute speed)

#### run driving logic

#### collect telemetry

#### handle screen and input

---

EV3RT API Mismatch
---

#### the EV3RT API is synchronous
#### it does not expose interrupts
#### tasks are cumbersome to use
#### (no channels)
#### it's like ⬜ squaring a ⚪ circle

#### but remember: 1㎳ latency is fine

---

💡 Idea: a Dumb `async` Runtime 💡
---

#### run a 1㎳ event loop collecting
#### all data with pending reads

#### use `Future` with no waker

#### implement `poll` checking for new data

#### in each event loop iteration
#### poll the root `Future`

---

`async` Event Loop
---

```rust
pub fn run(self, future: mut PinBoxed<impl Future<Output = ()>>) {
    let waker = noop_waker();
    let mut context = core::task::Context::from_waker(&waker);

    loop {
        self.ev3.update();
        if future.as_mut().poll(&mut context) == core::task::Poll::Ready(()) {
            break;
        }
        self.ev3.apply();
        ev3rt::msleep(1);
    }
    ev3rt::reset(false);
}
```

---

`async` Boilerplate
---

```rust
fn no_op(_: *const ()) {}
fn no_op_clone(_: *const ()) -> core::task::RawWaker {
    noop_raw_waker()
}
static RWVT: core::task::RawWakerVTable =
    core::task::RawWakerVTable::new(no_op_clone, no_op, no_op, no_op);

#[inline]
fn noop_raw_waker() -> core::task::RawWaker {
    core::task::RawWaker::new(core::ptr::null(), &RWVT)
}

#[inline]
fn noop_waker() -> core::task::Waker {
    unsafe { core::task::Waker::from_raw(noop_raw_waker()) }
}
```

---

A `main` function, `async` style
---

```rust
async fn main<EV3: Ev3Brick>(ev3: EV3) {
    ev3.init();
    ev3.setup().await;

    let error = ErrorTask::new();
    let motors = MotorsTask::new();
    let telemetry = TelemetryTask::new();

    zip!(
        error.run(&ev3),
        screens(&ev3, &error, &motors, &telemetry),
        motors.run(&ev3),
        telemetry.run(&ev3, &error, &motors)
    )
    .await;
}
```

---

The full `main_task` function
---

```rust
static FONT: Font<LcdTopSideUp> = build_font::<LcdTopSideUp>();
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn main_task() {
    let ev3 = Ev3::new(&FONT, Duration::from_ms(25));
    let future = main(ev3.clone());
    ev3.run(pin_boxed(future), false);
}
```

```rust
pub type PinBoxed<T> = core::pin::Pin<alloc::boxed::Box<T>>;
pub fn pin_boxed<T>(t: T) -> PinBoxed<T> {
    alloc::boxed::Box::pin(t)
}
```
