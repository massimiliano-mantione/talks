My Worlplace Since Sep 2020
---

##### _1st, a bit of history_
#### March 2009: Viamente
#### 🚙 routing as a service
#### 🚚 deliveries
##### 🛻 field services
##### two products
#### 🔧 routing engine
#### 💻 route manager

-------

My Worlplace Since Sep 2020
---

##### _next bit of history_

##### **August 2012**: _WorkWave acquires Viamente_

#### 🌍 Worldwide Growth 🌍
##### over time, lots of new features

##### **January 2020**: _Global Pandemic_
#### 💥 Explosive Growth 💥
#### all _delivery_ customers
##### had **larger** problems
#### 🤔 algo performance 🤔

The Algorithm
---

#### mostly written by an
##### **operational research** professor

#### about 75k LOC of **C++**
##### *(mostly C with classes)*

##### **lots** of *features*

##### 😔 *a jungle of linked lists* 😔

-------

Technical Debt
---

#### if _anything_ can be
#### a *mutable shared global*
##### 😕 **it is so** 😕

##### *zero* **unit** tests

#### *lack* of properly
##### designed **abstractions**

##### *no* significant **refactorings**


-------

Performance Problems
---

##### *(handling larger problems)*

#### the algo requires
#### **full** edge **matrices**
##### (they grow *quadratically*)

#### linked *lists* are
##### **not cache friendly**

#### the **search** for
#### inter-route **exchanges**
##### grows *quadratically*


-------

OK, but... Rust?
---

#### initial *experiments*
##### analyzing **instances**

#### *3 months* of data
##### about **0.5 TB**

#### I needed *tools*
#### and
##### they had to be **fast**

#### 🦀

-------

We *Really* Need To Scale *Now*!
---

##### there was an **ongoing plan**
##### *splitting* large *problems*
##### *solving* the subpproblems
##### producing a *unified* solution
##### **the splitter was mostly done**

-------

Alternative Approaches
---

#### *minimal change*
#### implement a **C++** solution
##### orchestrator **in-process**

#### *use Rust* with *minimal change*
#### implement a **Rust** solution
##### orchestrator **in-process**

#### *use Rust* with *minimal risk*
#### implement a **Rust** solution
##### orchestrator **out-of-process**

-------

The Runner
---

#### thanks to the exploratory phase
##### there was Rust code to handle problems

#### we could implement the orchestrator
##### (we call it `runner`) in Rust

#### it mimics the underlying
##### algo process

#### minimal changes for the
##### Routing Engine

-------

Technical Highlights
---

##### the runner tries to stay out of the way
##### it is a very thin wrapper for its child process
##### almost zero CPU time (async, totally IO-bound)
#### it is also nontrivial
#### has several child processes, organized in stages
#### parses several children stdout streams in real time
#### merges children stdout events into a single event stream
#### writes to the children stdins to control them
#### collects all partial solutions from disk in real time
#### relays the event stream in its own stdout

-------

So far, so good...
---

#### we have Rust code in production
#### it is working flawlessly
#### it is working flawlessly
##### it is a success!

#### then management comes
#### knocking again

-------

We Need To Scale!
---

##### wait, didn't we implement the runner for this?
##### yes, but that was scaling up
##### now we need to scale out!

-------

Actual Goals
---

dynamically provision commpute power
(so we can afford more!)

simplify deployments
(now they mutate existing servers)

allow more tests and experiments
(now testing is too slow)
(now live experiments are unfeasible)

-------

The Algo Service
---

remember the Routing Engine server architecture?

the one with everything on every server?

let's recap...

Algo Service
---

to scale out

we take the algo processes
(the most compute intensive component)

and we move them into an external service
